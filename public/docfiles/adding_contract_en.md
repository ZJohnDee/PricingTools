# Adding a contract
## Overview
Contracts can be used to create an individualized project for a *client* by enabling or disabling certain *components* of
a specified *product*.
## Creating a new contract
When you press *Add* on the dashboard for adding a contract, you must select a *product* and a *client* to create the contract from. For a contract to be created there have to be at least one product and one client.
## What's on the screen?
To the left, there are all the components that are enabled. To the right, there are all the components that are not yet enabled.
Beneath each component, you can see the price of that component individually. Below all the components, which are activated, you can see the total price of the project, based on the components enabled and their respective settings.  
## Enabling / Disabling components
In order to enable a component, you must press on the *+* button. Press on the *trash can* to disable a component. Note that requried components cannot be disabled and are enabled by default. 
## Settings for each component
Depending on the type of the component, different settings can be applied. Components of the type *Add-On* have a fixed price and have therefore now further options. Components of the type *Amount* have a number as an input, which dictates how many times this component should be factored into the price. The resulting price is simply the product of the component's price (either its base price or a price derived from conditional pricing) mulitplied by the amount. 
Components of the type *Choice* have a choice selector. The selected choice affects the price of the component and possibly that of other's if conditional pricing is used.
